  <h3>üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h3>
  <p>Hi guys, I'm <b>GwangRok Baek</b> and I prefer to be called as <b>phil</b>!</p>
  <p>I've been an <b>Embedded System Engineer</b> for about two years. I became interested in low-level programming because the process of decoding and executing various     commands in cpu seemed to uncover the secrets of the computer.</p>
  <p>These days, <b>I'm looking forward to work as DL engineer</b>, especially with <b>lightweight / mobile deep learning models.</b> I decided to change my career from the embedded system to deep learning, thinking that a new challenge in the field of deep learning with infinite potential is a valuable research that can change the world. Of course, deep learning isn't a magic tool that solves everything, but it's already exceeding expectations in some applicable fields, and I think it will make a big difference in the edge systems market now. In this situation, I would like to contribute to the development of lightweight models by efficiently implementing model compression technology using my embedded knowledge. This is why I decided to challenge deep learning. üòÅ</p>
