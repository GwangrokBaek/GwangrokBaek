  <p>Hi guys, I'm <b>GwangRok Baek</b> and I prefer to be called as <b>phil</b>!</p>
  <p>I've been an <b>Embedded System Engineer</b> for about two years. I became interested in low-level programming because the process of decoding and executing various     commands in cpu seemed to uncover the secrets of the computer.</p>
  <p>These days, <b>I am interested in ML/DL</b> so I am learning mainly on <b>on-device AI</b> and <b>lightweight AI models.</b> And these experiences in AI <b>make me plan to switch the job from Embedded System Engineer to ML Engineer.</b>üòÅ</p>
